    """
    Simplify a line using the lang algorithm.

    The implementation also supports an alternative behaviour of the standard lang
    algorithm to increase the potential number of points removed from the input
    coordinates, without violating the tolerance specified. The standard lang algorithm
    will always retain at least ~ len(coords) / lookahead points in the output, even for
    a line with all collinear point. Par example when lookahead=3, this leads to keeping
    at least 33% of the input points in the output. Using simplify_lookahead_points=True
    will remove this limitation, at the cost of some extra processing time.

    Inspiration for the standard lang implementation came from:
        * https://github.com/giscan/Generalizer/blob/master/simplify.py
        * https://github.com/keszegrobert/polyline-simplification/blob/master/6.%20Lang.ipynb

        tolerance (float): distance tolerance to use.

            in a moving window. Defaults to 8.
        simplify_lookahead_points (bool, optional): True to also simplify the lookahead
            points. Defaults to False. More info available in the function description.

    Returns:
        Return the coordinates kept after simplification.
        If input coords is np.ndarray or CoordinateSequence, returns np.ndarray,
        otherwise returns a list.
